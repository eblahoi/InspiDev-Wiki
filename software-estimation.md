# Software Estimation

### Work Breakdown Structure \(WBS\)

Work Breakdown Structure - bottom-up estimation approach.

#### Concept

* Break down large tasks into smaller tasks
* Repeat until tasks are relatively easy to estimate \(1-3 days of work\)
* Estimate each task using 3-point estimation technique
* Compute a total project estimate by summing up the estimates

#### Three-point estimation tecnique

Come up with 3 estimates for a task:

* Best-case estimate
* Most likely estimate
* Worst-case estimate

Calculate an estimate as a weighted average:

$$
estimate = (BestCase + 4 * MostLikely + WorstCase)/6
$$

#### **Best practices**

* Document the **assumptions** and **decisions** that influenced the estimate
* Group tasks by **feature/epic** and **dependencies** to ease descoping process
* Split tasks into separate technical areas \(e.g. back-end, front-end, mobile, database, devops\)

## Estimation by proxy

## Best practices

* Split development in **phases**. Helps with building a schedule and parallelizing work.
* Never present a single number, use **ranges**.
* When launching a new project account for a team ramp-up and environment set-up
* Account for scrum overhead, QC and unit testing
* Use peast estimates for your team/organisations to calibrate estimation variables
